# SPIMArena

SPIMBot has been the capstone project of the semester for CS 233 at UIUC for many semesters. It is final,
class-wide competition with the goal of writing a program (SPIMBot) in the MIPS assembly language, which
has been studied all semester, that will score best in class.

SPIMArena take this competition to the next level by allowing a web interface to the competition so that
students can gauge their performance and enjoy a meta-game, increasing the challenge and excitement of
this final project.
