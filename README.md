# SPIMArena

SPIMBot is the semester capstone project for CS 233 (Computer Architecture) at UIUC. It is a class-wide 
competition with the goal of writing a program, called SPIMBot, in the MIPS assembly language, which
the students have studied all semester.

SPIMArena takes this competition to the next level by allowing a web interface to the competition so that
students can gauge their performance and enjoy a meta-game, increasing the challenge and excitement of
this final project.
